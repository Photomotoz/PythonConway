## Conway's Game of Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python

## Installation
This program should be compatible with any version of Python 2.7 and up, and as such having a correct version of Python installed is the only requirement.

## Usage
The program takes arguments for the number of iterations and for a text file representing the starting state of the grid.

Example :
python conway.py 20 test_grid

## Grid Files
A sample grid file is provided in test_grid.
A grid file is simply a plaintext file with rows of '0's and '1's
'0's represent unpopulated cells, whereas the '1's represent populated cells.
The number of columns for each row must remain the same but there is no restriction on the number of rows or columns you may have.
